Types of References

Branches
HEAD

Branch
A Pointer to a particular commit
The pointer of the current branch changes as new commits are made

HEAD
How git knows what branch you are currently on, and what the next parent will be
It's a pointer 
    Points to the name of the current branch
    But can also point to a commit too(detached head)
It moves when
    You make a commit in the currently active branch
    You checkout a new branch

Tags
lightweight tags
A simple pointer to commits
When you create a tag with no arguments, It captures the value in the head

Annotated Tags - Git tag -a
Point to a commit but store additional information
 -Author, message, date 


Working with tags

git tag -a v1.0 -m 'Version 1 of my blog' - Creates a tag
git show v1.0 - gives the info e.g msg, author etc
git tag - list tags(lightweight and annotated)
git show-ref --tags - List all tags and the commit they point to
git tag --points-at <commit> - show all tags pointing at a commit
git show <tag-name> - Looking at the tag, or tagged contents

Tags && Branches
----------------
Branch - Branch pointer moves with every commit to the repository
Tag - The commit a tag points to doesn't change
    - Its a snapshot
