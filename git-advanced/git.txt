Git 
A distributed version control system

Stores info in key-value pair stores where:
    Key = Hash of the data
    Value = The actual data
The key can be used to retrieve the content

KEY 
Cryptographic hash function.
Hashes data into a 40-digit hexadecimal number
Hashing(If input is the same the hash will also be the same)
    Git log - lists the hashes(Sha 1 hashes)

VALUE - The blob
Git stores compressed data in a blob along with metadata in a header
.git - directory that stores info on the repository
tree .git -- command to give an overview of directory structure

The blob is stored in the objects directory
Blob misses some info e.g filenames && dirctories. 
Git stores this in a tree 
Tree = Pointers to: blobs and other trees
    metadata: {
        type of Pointer
        file or directory name 
        mode e.g executable file, symbolic link e.t.c
    }
Identical content is only stored once (from the nature of the SHAs)
(Helps save tons of space)
If blobs and trees do not change during commits, it still points to the same copies

Git Optimizations
Objects are compressed
As files change their contents remain mostly similar
Git optimizes for this by compressing files together into a packfile
packfiles store the objects and deltas - Differences in one file version to another
Packfiles are generated when:
You have too many objects, during gc(garbage collection) or pudh to a remote

Commits
Commit points to a tree
Contains metadata: Author and committer, date, message, parent commit(one or more)
The SHA1 of the commit is a hash of the above
TREE - Snapshot of the repository

git cat -file -t r674yfuoi
//running this aginist some sample hash
-t - print the type
-p - Print the content

Commits can't be changed: Any of its data changes, it acquires a new hash
Even if files don't change the date will

References
Pointers to commits
Tags, branches, HEAD 
HEAD - Points to the current commit
When you checkout a branch, HEAD points to the current branch
The refs in the .git directory
refs/heads - All the branches live here 
cat /.git/HEAD - May show the branch where HEAD is currently on.
