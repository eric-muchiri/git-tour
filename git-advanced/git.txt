Git 
A distributed version control system

Stores info in key-value pair stores where:
    Key = Hash of the data
    Value = The actual data
The key can be used to retrieve the content

KEY 
Cryptographic hash function.
Hashes data into a 40-digit hexadecimal number
Hashing(If input is the same the hash will also be the same)
    Git log - lists the hashes(Sha 1 hashes)

VALUE - The blob
Git stores compressed data in a blob along with metadata in a header
.git - directory that stores info on the repository
tree .git -- command to give an overview of directory structure

The blob is stored in the objects directory
Blob misses some info e.g filenames && dirctories. 
Git stores this in a tree 
Tree = Pointers to: blobs and other trees
    metadata: {
        type of Pointer
        file or directory name 
        mode e.g executable file, symbolic link e.t.c
    }
